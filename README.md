# Gravitational-wave-analysis

This project is about analysing the GW190521 gravitational wave and estimating the parameters like mass, distance, pahse, inclination, FAR, SNR using CBC waveform model and burst model. Most of the code lines are reused from the jupyter notebook from the module and involves packages released by LIGO to calculate and produce waveforms.
